                <h2>Penetration Testing – Part 1</h2>
                <h3>Reconnaissance</h3>
                <p>Gathered information about the target using various methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>WHOIS Lookup:</strong> Retrieved domain registration details such as registrar and owner information.</li>
                    <li><strong>DNS Footprinting:</strong> Collected DNS records like A, MX, and TXT using tools such as <code>nslookup</code> and <code>dig</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Footprinting:</strong> Mapped the network using tools like <code>Traceroute</code> and <code>Nmap</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Leveraged publicly available information from social media and forums to understand potential weaknesses.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Port Scanning</h3>
                <p>Identified open ports and associated services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used <code>nmap</code> to perform scans and determine services running on specific ports (e.g., SSH, FTP).</li>
                    <li>Discovered MSSQL instances using <code>nmap</code> scripting features.</li>
                    <li>Identified and documented services such as SSH, FTP, and SNMP.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Vulnerability Scanning</h3>
                <p>Conducted vulnerability analysis using multiple tools:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SMB Login Check:</strong> Tested for weak credentials on SMB shares using <code>smbclient</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>VNC Authentication:</strong> Checked for vulnerabilities in VNC services to exploit unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li><strong>WMAP Web Scanner:</strong> Analyzed web applications for vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nessus:</strong> Ran a comprehensive vulnerability scan, identifying misconfigurations and missing patches.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    The reconnaissance phase provided critical insights into the target, enabling focused scanning and vulnerability identification. 
                    Open ports and vulnerable services were documented, forming the foundation for further penetration testing in <strong>Project 2</strong>.

                <h2>Penetration Testing – Part 2</h2>
                
                <h3>Client-Side Attacks</h3>
                <p>Performed various client-side attack techniques, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Binary Payloads:</strong> Created and deployed executable payloads to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Client-Side Exploits:</strong> Exploited client-side vulnerabilities in applications such as browsers and email clients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Engineering Toolkit:</strong> Used tools like the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) to simulate phishing attacks and gather credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Gained elevated privileges through misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Post-Exploitation Techniques</h3>
                <p>Executed advanced post-exploitation tasks to control the system and extract critical information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Identified and exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pass the Hash:</strong> Used hashed credentials to access other systems without cracking passwords.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Event Management:</strong> Cleared event logs to remove traces of exploitation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interacting with the Registry:</strong> Accessed and modified registry keys to maintain persistence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Packet Sniffing:</strong> Captured network traffic to analyze sensitive data in transit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen Capture:</strong> Took screenshots to monitor user activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Searching for Content:</strong> Searched for sensitive files and information on the compromised system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Stamp Modification:</strong> Altered timestamps to obscure activity logs.</li>
                    <li><strong>John the Ripper:</strong> Used John the Ripper for password cracking and analysis.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Maintaining Access</h3>
                <p>Implemented techniques to ensure continued access to the system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keylogging:</strong> Monitored and captured keystrokes to gather credentials and monitor user activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistent Backdoors:</strong> Installed backdoors for long-term access to the system.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    The techniques used in client-side attacks, post-exploitation, and access maintenance were critical in demonstrating how 
                    attackers can exploit and control systems. These tasks complement the reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning conducted 
                    in <strong>Project 1</strong> to form a comprehensive penetration testing methodology.
